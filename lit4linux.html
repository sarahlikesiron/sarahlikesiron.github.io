            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Web and Mobile II was a class that had 2 major projects, one that we did on our own and one that was a group project.For the group project we were tasked with designing and developing a website to teach a group of people Linux.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <h4>Design Document</h4>
            <p>The first part of the project involved planning everything out, including wireframes for every page and feature we wanted to add and all of the content.  We had to research competitor sites and create persona's to try and narrow down exactly how we wanted the site to turn out.  Most of my involvement in this part was organizing meetings, dividing up work, and finding various resources for us to use and compare with what we wanted.  I have included a version of our final design document to illustrate what exactly this part of the project included.</p>

            <h4>Site Development</h4>
            <p>The second part of the project was actually developing the site that we had created in the first part.  This was where I did a lot of work.  I created the whole flashcard page and was responsible for the css for the whole site.  One of my group members created mockups that we then recreated (to the best of our ability) into an actual site. While we were not able to include everything we originally planned on, we still accomplished a lot and our final product turned out really good.</p>

            <h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
            <p>This project pushed the limits of what I knew how to do using CSS and Javascript, but in a way that made me learn more than I ever had and greatly benefitted me.</p>
            <h4>Improvements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add additional pages (original intended features)</li>
                <li>Update home page to have more information</li>
                <li>Fix some style errors</li>
                <li>Add something that indicates what page/section a user is on</li>
            </ul>
