            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In Web and Mobile II we were tasked to develop a website for one of our favorite places and I chose Allegany State Park in New York.  I decided to focus on everything the park has to offer, as well as highlighting a couple points that are my favorite about the park.  We originally had to create at least 10 pages of content, but that was later expanded to also include a comment form page.  The site includes an overview page, a timeline page talking about the park's history, a page about the different sleeping options offered in the park, information about all of the trails, and then information about the different parts of the park and what can be done at each.  I decided to use blue, green, and gray as the main colors of the website, as I feel like they represent a park and would be attractive to the eye.  All of the photos featured on the site are my own, taken during my various trips I've made there over the years.  Allegany State Park did not have a website about them and I really felt like they needed someone to make one to let people know that they exist.</p>
