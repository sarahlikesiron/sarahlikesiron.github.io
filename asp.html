            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In Web and Mobile II we were tasked to develop a website for one of our favorite places and I chose Allegany State Park in New York.  I decided to focus on everything the park has to offer, as well as highlighting a couple points that are my favorite about the park.  We originally had to create at least 10 pages of content, but that was later expanded to also include a comment form page.  The site includes an overview page, a timeline page talking about the park's history, a page about the different sleeping options offered in the park, information about all of the trails, and then information about the different parts of the park and what can be done at each.  I decided to use blue, green, and gray as the main colors of the website, as I feel like they represent a park and would be attractive to the eye.  All of the photos featured on the site are my own, taken during my various trips I've made there over the years.  Allegany State Park did not have a website about them and I really felt like they needed someone to make one to let people know that they exist.</p>

            <h3>First Launch</h3>
            <p>For the first part of this project, we just had to develop at least 10 pages of content, with images and at least one map.  I chose to include a map of the various trails in the park, adding it onto the pages that describe hiking in the park.  Additionally, every image on the site (besides the map) I took myself last fall, because I love the park and very few images of it exist.  One feature that I included that was a little different than what others did was the timeline page, where I detailed the major events in the park and featured a javascript action to display more text for oneof the events.  I slightly ran out of time when I was working on it, but was able to fix everyhting I did not like when I did the second half of the project.</p>
            <h3>Second Launch</h3>
            <p>The second part of the project was a little more complex.  First we had to fix everything that we had gotten points off on the first part, most of mine was just fixing the media queries, the sizing of the text, and a couple other small things.  We then had to add a page allowing people to leave comments on, using php, sql, and javascript to list all of the comments that already exist in the database and then adding any new ones.  One requirement that we had for that was to sanitize the comments before adding them to our database, so that they could not perform any malicious actions against us.  Some of the final things we had to add was some sort of image gallery and then to make the site responsive.  For the image gallery I created a slider on the home page that changes the parallex image when either of the arrows are pressed.  Media queries were fixed and then a hamburger menu was added for navigation on smaller screens.  We really applied everything that we learned from the beginning of the semester to the end with this project.</p>

            <h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
            <p>I would say I am overall satisfied with this project.  I think it introduces all of the basics of the park and could potentially fill the need for a site for the park.  Visiting it to take photos was a lot of fun and inspired me to work hard on the site to try and represent the park well.  I also learned a lot about the park's history that I did not know before because I had to visit the museum to construct the timeline page.  As with any project there are things about it that I really like and things that I would really want to change at some point.</p>
            <h4>Future Improvements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add more information to all of the pages</li>
                <li>Fix the arrows for the home page image gallery</li>
                <li>Make the trails interactive with the map</li>
                <li>Some general layout fixes</li>
            </ul>
