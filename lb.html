            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The last project in my New Media Design class involved us coming up with an idea for an app and then designing the icon, screens, and a promotional poster for it.  We used Illustrator for this whole project, which was a new program for me and definitely took a decent amount of adjusting to.  I had never designed an app before, let alone a poster, so I went into this project very unsure and anxious, but I think that I ended with decent results.  One thing that I really enjoyed was that we had to print out our posters and then on the last class day we hung them all up and critiqued them and then voted on our favorites, which was a fun and interesting experience.  Unfortunately I seem to not have many of the intermediate files for this project, but I have all of the results.  If any more are found I will add them when I can.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
            <p>As with every project, the first thing that we were tasked to do for this project was to brainstorm and sketch ideas.  They were then presented to the class, who gave feedback and helped to decide which idea you should develop further into an app design.  I initially struggled with coming up with ideas, but ended up deciding on an idea that would have helped younger me.  I was really involved in my high school's rocket club and launching rockets always turned into a hassle to try and collect the necessary data, mainly because we were in the middle of a muddy and windy field and no one wanted to bring their laptops out and our paper would always blow away.  So the concept for Launch Buddy was born.</p>

            <h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
            <p>I generally feel like a lot more could be done with this project.  It was my first attempt at designing any form of app and poster and I really struggled with it.  I think the concept for the app is solid, but the product that I developed needs some work.  Pinning down exactly what needs to be improved is difficult, as almost everything needs some work.  I am proud of what I made as my first attempt at anything like this and as I continue to learn and grow I like looking back on the beginning.</p>
            <h4>Improvements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Flush out more of the design and interactions</li>
                <li>General changes to the whole design</li>
            </ul>
