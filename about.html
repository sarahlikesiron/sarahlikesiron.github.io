            <h4>hiking</h4>
            <p>I grew up sort of in the country, so I spent a lot of time outside just exploring and having fun.  My family also went camping and hiking often, which I loved and still love to do.  For the past 2 summers I have gone hiking in the Adirondacks, where we hiked Mount Marcy and also spent time camping at the Marcy Dam (which is primitive) and I hope to go again this summer.  I enjoy many ways to spend my time outside, but hiking has to be my favorite.</p>

            <p>I also really enjoy taking photos outside, so I have included a selection of images I have taken on my various hikes, as nature and the Earth are beautiful.</p>
            <p>(currently building the gallery, will update when done)</p>

            <h4>nancy drew</h4>
            <p>Growing up I read a lot of Nancy Drew and my interest and love for her still continue to this day.  I have also played almost all of the video games released related to her (all of which are amazing) and have watched most of the shows with her either starring or just in them.  I do not own all of the main books, but I own a decent amount and slowly am trying to get the rest of them whenever I can find them for cheap.  I enjoy the series because it is entertaining, but also because Nancy is a strong female character and it is nice to see her succeed when it can be hard for women to.</p>

            <h4>video games</h4>
            <p>My enjoyment of video games is not only limited to the Nancy Drew ones, it spans all genres.  While I will always enjoy bad or old games, such as Rollercoaster Tycoon, I have fallen in love with games such as Animal Crossing New Horizons and The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild when I originally doubted that I would.  I spent a long time limiting the games that I played to avoid ones that I might potentially be "bad" or "not perfect" at and now I play and enjoy any game that sounds interesting to me without worrying about any of those things.</p>
