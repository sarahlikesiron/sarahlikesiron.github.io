            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>I created this project for my New Media Design and Development 1 class, where we learned how to use Illustrator and Photoshop.  The goal of this project was to design the landing page for a website that would serve a specific purpose, focusing in on a topic that a need exists for.  My site is intended for people who enjoy camping, but find the process of finding a specific site type (such as camper, tent, primitive) in the area they want to go without having to check multiple websites to find what they want.  Basically streamlining the process of finding a campsite by centralizing all of the sites data onto one site.  Similar to how hotel deal sites have a bunch of different hotel chains listed, although mine is of campsites and not deals.</p>
