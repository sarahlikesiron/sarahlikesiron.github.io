            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>gf this is an app design/prototype that I created for a project in Foundations of Mobile Design.  It is intended to make any recipe accessible to celiac/gluten-free individuals, since finding recipes that are gluten-free for certain foods can be difficult and figuring out substitions on your own can be very complicated.  I know that my dad once made a bunch of batches of cinnamon rolls with each one having a different flour/add-in ratio to try and get the consistency the same.  Having an app that could analyze the recipe he wanted to use then and then suggesting various substitutions that could be used and would be best definitely would have been useful to him them.</p>
            <p>The app works in two different ways, one in which you have an acccount, and the other where you don't want to make an account or save recipes.  I know that being required to sign up for an app right after you download it is annoying to me, so I figured adding this page could maybe improve user's experience.</p>

            <h4>Wireframing + Designing</h4>
            <p>Following the completion of my initial sketches, I started working in Figma to develop my prototype.  First I began with creating the basic layout of the pages and decided on the general color theme and fonts used.  I wanted to make it so that certain information stood out very easily from the rest, such as the ingredients being highlighted in pink that need to be fixed, and so that no mistakes could hypothetically be made.  There's a couple interaction problems that I hope to one day fix, but overall the idea is there.</p>
